#### Frequently Asked Questions

[FAQ01: How do I get help if my question is not in this list?](https://google.com)

We have a web based application system but it is important to know that the web account that you use to log into portal.cs.umb.edu is separate than a UNIX account. The web account is like a gateway to manage your UNIX account but they are separate. For example, if you were to change your password on your web account, your UNIX account will remain with the same previous password until you log in through ssh and change it using yppasswd on any of our public hosts. See an operator if you have any additional questions.

To get a UNIX account for your course there are three scenarios you could be in: you already have an existing UNIX account but have never seen the new web-based application system, you are a new student that needs a new account or you have both a web account and UNIX account.

Existing UNIX account owner
If you already have a Unix account but have not registered with the new Apply program you must go to Portal to register. Be sure to click the checkbox labeled "Select if you already have a Unix account" you will then need to enter your account's username and password along with your UMB email address.
If your username and password match a Unix account you will receive an email at your UMB email address for confirmation. When you click the link in that email you will be registered and will then be able to select your courses for the semester currently available

New students to the departement
The process is very similar to the one above except that you won't be checking off the box labeled "Select if you already have a Unix account". Head over to Portal to register. Enter the fields requested along with your UMB email address.
We will be checking that the username you requested does not match an existing Unix account, in the case that the username is already taken you will be asked to enter another one. Once you have pressed submit you will receive an email at the UMB email address you provided for confirmation. When you click the link in that email you have successfully submitted a request for a new account and will then be able to select your courses for the semester currently available.
