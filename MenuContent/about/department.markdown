Welcome to the Computer Science department at UMass Boston! The goal of the department is to offer excellence in research, teaching and technical skills.

If you are wondering what you can do with a Computer Science degree, there are several career options available to you. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Computer Science occupations are projected to grow more than twice as fast as the average for all other occupations.

Our bachelors programs, including the BS program in Computer Science that is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, [http://www.abet.org](http://www.abet.org), offer a wide variety of courses such as artificial intelligence, cyber security, database-backed web development, data mining, and system administration.

At the doctoral level, our research faculty and PhD students are investigating topics in applied database research, bioinfomatics, computer graphics, computer vision, cybersecurity, data mining, distributed software systems, higher performance computing, network information systems, programming languages, theoretical computer science, and visual attention.

Within this site you will find information regarding admissions, undergraduate and graduate programs, facilities in the department, as well as seminars and events. We have also included directions to the department and the campus as an invitation to come by and visit us anytime. Join us and explore the possibilities that await you here at UMass Boston; become a leader in computing research, academia, or industry.
