The department offers an Honors Program option for those who qualify. To graduate with department Honors in Computer Science, a Computer Science major must satisfy the following requirements:

1. Maintain a GPA of 3.0 or above in his/her university studies
2. Maintain a GPA of 3.5 or above in his/her major courses
3. Successfully complete CS498, including an oral defense of the Honors Thesis

For the defense of the Honors Thesis, the faculty supervisor will form a committee consisting of himself/herself and two colleagues whose backgrounds are relevant to the project. The membership of the committee is subject to approval by the undergraduate program director or chair. All members of the committee must be present for the defense of the thesis and must deem it worthy of honors recognition. Whether or not the defense is successful, credit for CS498 will be granted based on a passing grade by the faculty advisor. Honors theses will be published by the department as Technical Reports, so they will be accessible from both inside and outside the department.
