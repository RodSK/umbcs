Compiler organization and construction. Programming projects involve scanning input, analyzing program structure, error checking, code translation and interpreting, code generation and optimization. These projects result in a compiler for a reasonably large subset of ALGOL, Pascal, or similar procedural language.

This course is co-taught with CS451.

**Pre-requisites**
\
CS310 and CS420 or CS622.
